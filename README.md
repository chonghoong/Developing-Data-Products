### Application description
This Shiny application displays the fuel consumption based on the transmission type, cylinders and horse power variables.

### Usage
Usage:

1. Change the input data value of cylinders, transmission type and/or horse power.
2. Summary measures for miles/gallon should reflect the change accordingly.

### Presentation Pitch
